= Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS

This is a Kubernetes Operator to manage Apache HDFS ensembles.

It is written by https://www.stackable.de[Stackable] in Rust, and it is supposed to be used with the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent[Stackable Agent] instead of the Kubernetes kubelet.

The docs can be found in the `docs` subdirectory, and they are published together with docs for all other Stackable products at https://docs.stackable.tech.
