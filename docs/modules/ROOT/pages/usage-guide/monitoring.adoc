= Monitoring

The cluster can be monitored with Prometheus from inside or outside the K8S cluster.

All services (with the exception of the Zookeeper daemon on the node names) run with the JMX exporter agent enabled and expose metrics on the `metrics` port. This port is available form the container level up to the NodePort services.

The metrics endpoints are also used as liveliness probes by K8S.

The managed HDFS instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See
xref:home:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.
