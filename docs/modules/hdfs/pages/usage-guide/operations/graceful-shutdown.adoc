= Graceful shutdown

You can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

== JournalNodes

As a default, JournalNodes have `15 minutes` to shut down gracefully.

The JournalNode process receives a `SIGTERM` signal when Kubernetes wants to terminate the Pod.
It logs the received signal as shown in the log below and initiate a graceful shutdown.
After the graceful shutdown timeout runs out, and the process still didn't exit, Kubernetes issues a `SIGKILL` signal.

== DataNodes

As a default, DataNodes have `30 minutes` to shut down gracefully.
They use the same mechanism described above.
