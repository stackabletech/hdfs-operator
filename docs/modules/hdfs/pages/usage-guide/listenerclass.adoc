= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

The Operator deploys a service called `<name>-<role>-<rolegroup>` (where `<name>` is the name of the HdfsCluster, `<role>` is the role and `<rolegroup>` the name of the role group) through which the different HDFS processes can be accessed. Unlike many other Stackable Operators, the HDFS Operator does not deploy role-level Services.

These services can have either the `cluster-internal` or `external-unstable` type. `external-stable` is not supported for HDFS at the moment. Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the listener class is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.
