= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

The operator deploys a xref:listener-operator:listener.adoc[Listener] for each DataNode and NameNode pod. They both default to only being accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster, but this can be changed by setting `.spec.{data,name}Nodes.config.listenerClass`.

Note that JournalNodes are not accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

The cluster can be configured to be accessible from outside of Kubernetes like this:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  dataNodes:
    config:
      listenerClass: external-unstable # <1>
  nameNodes:
    config:
      listenerClass: external-stable # <2>
----
<1> DataNode listeners should prioritize having a direct connection, to minimize network transfer overhead.
<2> NameNode listeners should prioritize having a stable address, since they will be baked into the client configuration.
