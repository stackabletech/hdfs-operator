= Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS

The Stackable Operator for https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html[Apache HDFS] is used to set up HFDS in high-availability mode. It depends on the xref:zookeeper:index.adoc[] to operate a ZooKeeper cluster to coordinate the active and standby NameNodes.

NOTE: This operator only works with images from the https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable%2Fhadoop[Stackable] repository

== Roles

Three xref:home:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[roles] of the HDFS cluster are implemented:

* DataNode - responsible for storing the actual data.
* JournalNode - responsible for keeping track of HDFS blocks and used to perform failovers in case the active NameNode
  fails. For details see: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithQJM.html
* NameNode - responsible for keeping track of HDFS blocks and providing access to the data.

== Kubernetes objects

The operator creates the following K8S objects per role group defined in the custom resource.

* Service - ClusterIP used for intra-cluster communication.
* ConfigMap - HDFS configuration files like `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml` and `log4j.properties` are defined here and
  mounted in the pods.
* StatefulSet - where the replica count, volume mounts and more for each role group is defined.

In addition, a `NodePort` service is created for each pod labeled with `hdfs.stackable.tech/pod-service=true` that
exposes all container ports to the outside world (from the perspective of K8S).

In the custom resource you can specify the number of replicas per role group (NameNode, DataNode or JournalNode). A
minimal working configuration requires:

* 2 NameNodes (HA)
* 1 JournalNode
* 1 DataNode (should match at least the `clusterConfig.dfsReplication` factor)

== Supported Versions

The Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS currently supports the following versions of HDFS:
