// The version ranges supported by HDFS-Operator
// This is a separate file, since it is used by both the direct HDFS-Operator documentation, and the overarching
// Stackable Platform documentation.

- 3.4.0 (experimental) - We do ship 3.4.0 but we do _not_ support upgrading to 3.4 at the moment. If you are currently on 3.3 please do not attempt to upgrade but stay on 3.3.
- 3.3.6 (LTS) - Please note that there is a https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/issues/440[known issue] related to NameNode bootstrapping which can happen in rare cases. It is therefore recommended to use `3.3.4` until the problem is resolved.
- 3.3.4 (LTS)
